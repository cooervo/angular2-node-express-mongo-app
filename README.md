MEAN app (with Angular 2):

1) open console and cd into this current dir: 

     cd app

2) run command: 

     sh run.sh

Above command dumps data into mongo, installs client & server 
dependencies, then runs node server. Once node is running:

3) In NEW console terminal go to app/client and start Webpack:

     npm start

4) navigate app at: http://localhost:3000/
